            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And thus indeed the Boores of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> did about the end of Ianuary, when as they enforced two Regiments to retire with ſome loſſe, that <hi>volens nolens</hi> would haue thruſt themſelues upon them. About the 20 of Ianuary Duke <hi>Bernhard,</hi> for the caſe of <hi>Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg,</hi> and the refreſhment of his owne people, ſent 100 Cornets of Horſe, and 148 foot Companies to bee laid in garriſon in the townes of <hi>Franconia.</hi> Great ſtore of all manner of proviſions were taken order for to be ſent into <hi>Norimberg</hi> for the making of a magazine in that City.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19441:6"/>together about <hi>Deckendorff</hi> about 3000 ſtrong, Horſemen and Dragooners; where he fell unawares into the quarters of the Swediſh. The chiefe ſpoil he did, was unto the Satleriſh Regiment, which indeed they did great harme unto. The Regiment of <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> they likewiſe aſſaulted, but the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which they did to that was, the ſpoyling of their baggage, and the taking priſoners of ſome of the Officers. This hapned in the time that the moſt of the Swediſh forces were gone out of <hi>Deckendorff</hi> upon other employments. At which time this <hi>Iohn de Werth</hi> was known to bee going upon another way towards the reliefe of <hi>Weyden</hi> in the upper <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate;</hi> which hearing to be taken by <hi>Vitzdumb,</hi> he all on the ſudden turnes with his Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners upon <hi>Deckendorff.</hi> Having done the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſpoyle, hee retired in good time, for that the wayes were hilly. In the meane ſeaſon did thoſe few Swediſh Horſemen and Dragooners that were in the towne, get them to their Armes and Horſes, and in ſeveral partees made out after their pillagers.

               <p>Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> in the meane time being at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſpurg,</hi> was buſied in fortifying the City, in this very beginning of February, ſetting upon the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at the Hoff and the Drawbridge at the ſtone Bridge.

Therefore was it beſieged, and about the firſt of February were ſome Ordnance and Petards ſet to <hi>Waldan,</hi> then lying before it, with all violence to haſten the conqueſt of it. By this means was it in a few dayes brought to a compoſition,<note place="margin">Falkenſtain taken by the Swedes.</note> wherein was much Amunition and other proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken. It was reſolved that this Caſtle ſhould be demoliſhed, like as that of <hi>Donawſtauff</hi> had bin ſerved. The Bavarian Boores in the Market townes hereabouts were now up in armes, and did ſome ſhrewd turnes now and then unto the Swediſh: but moſt eſpecially were they ſtrong and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the faire Market towne of <hi>Kitringen</hi> in the Forreſt; which when the Swediſh ſummoned,

What ever Duke <hi>Bernhards</hi> anſwer was unto his Couſin <hi>Francis Albert,</hi> himſelfe did in the meane time goe forward with his preparations. For now cauſes he his Ship bridge to be carried downe the <hi>Danuby,</hi> which was to be laid over at <hi>Olderhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> All the Army likewiſe that was to be enquarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about <hi>Regenſpurg</hi> were warned alſo to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and to march: At <hi>Waldmunſhen</hi> alſo, <hi>Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee</hi> and other places many hundreds of Wheele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrowes, pickeaxes, ſhovells and Iron bullets were made ready, and all for ſome warlike expedition. <hi>Febr.</hi> the 19 did the blew Regiment with 5 peeces of Ordnance march out of <hi>Regenſpurg,</hi> Duke <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> himſelf following after, who was that night to lodge at <hi>Schwandorff.</hi> In <hi>Regenſpurg</hi> was Generall Major <hi>Chog,</hi> (a <hi>Swede</hi>) left for Governour.

After which there came one troope of Ambergers after another into the field, and preſented themſelves 400 ſtrong. By which thoſe of <hi>Vilſeck</hi> perceived what aſcowring they had ſcaped. The Swediſh horſemen iſſued out of the towne to skirmiſh with them, with the loſſe of one Sergeant that was taken priſoner: The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergers afterwards retired alſo into their towne. They ſtill keep a Count of the Swediſh partee there in arreſt; as alſo two Ritmaſters, and one Captaine Lieuetenant. But Lievetenant <hi>Dyvell,</hi> with other officers and ſouldiers before taken by them, were ſent home freely by them.

               </p>
               <p>For performance now of my foreſaid purpoſe &amp; deſigne, I upon this day ſeventhnight (which was the 9/19 of this month) diſlodged from <hi>Ravenſpurg,</hi> arriving the next day before the town of <hi>Bibrach,</hi> together with the troops which I led along with me. The ſame night I began my approaches, and the next day after, I gave ſummons unto the City. I profferred unto Colonell <hi>Stralſoldo,</hi> Governour in the towne, a fayre agreement, but hee would not hearken unto it, ſaying hee was reſolved to defend his town to the uttermoſt. The third day I got my Ordnance to me, which ſooner I could not, for that the wayes were ſo deep and durty. The Ordnance being mounted, I battered the towne ſo long, till I firſt woon the Breaſtwork from the enemy, and had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19441:26"/>made a ſaultable breach into the wals. This done, the foreſaid Colonell then ſent a Trumpet to mee, together with ſome Proteſtant Citizens, to deſire a reaſonable agreement of me; which was, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might march forth with all his forces. The Trumpet moreover then ſignified unto me, that if his Colonell might not march forth freely, that he would defend the town to the laſt man. And that firſt of all he would burne and blow up all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſtant Citizens which he had already locked up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town houſe, and into a Cellar. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, for that I ſuppoſed the Governour would never offer to deale ſo barbarouſly with the poore innocents, and for that hee had already deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my firſt good offer, and eſpecially indeed for that I had a minde to ruine the ſaid garriſon, I refuſed to grant him any ſuch agreement, propounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him, to yeeld upon diſcretion. After all this, when as all things were now ready for the aſſault, and that the troops appointed for the ſcaling were already now advanced towards the Breach, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Miniſters, together with divers women, came forth of the town, making a moſt pittifull cry and entreaty to me, ſignifying it would coſt all their lives, for that the Town houſe was already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and the Myne filled with powder, and that they certainly cxpected to bee blown up immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Out of commiſeration therefore to thoſe poore people, I offered another agreement unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, propounding to have Hoſt ages ſent out unto me. This hee then did, ſo that the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19441:27"/>I ſent in the Articles of agreement in writing to him, wherein I granted to him to march out free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though with no other weapons than their ſwords only. To leaue all their Colours behinde them, upon a promiſe to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vayed into <hi>Ingolſtadt</hi> upon theſe termes, he the ſame day marched forth. Of all this whole garriſon, which was the Regiment of the ſaid Colonell <hi>Stralſoldo,</hi> conſiſting of to Companies, together with 300 commanded men of the Archiſh and Goiſh Regiments, in all 1500 men of foot, and one troop of Horſe, there went none away with their Colonell but his Lackey on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſome few Officers. All the reſt of them took ſervice of us, to which they were no wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, but did it willingly. Thus fell it out bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us, than I could have imagined, for which wee have great cauſe to thank God Almighty, and beſeech him to continue his favour and fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards us.</p>

Some ſhorts are made againſt the walls, and ſome Granadoes ſhot and flung into the Towne, though with no great operation; their Petars did moſt dammage, by force of which, one of the gates was blowne open: Againſt that the townſmen caſt vp a trench of earth or <hi>Vau-mure.</hi> Hereupon the Imperialiſts ſent in a Drum, with Articles of agreement, if the Towne would yeeld to them; but the Conditions were impoſſible, for that the whole Imperiall contribution was now demanded, which (according to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) was behind-hand ſince laſt Eaſter. This if it might not bee ſatisfied, man, woman and child were threatned to die for it.</p>
                  <p>The Towne Counſellors and Lieutenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing themſelues not able to reſiſt theſe threatnings, condiſcend to pay what they were able, and ſend out ſome of theirs to be Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for it.</p>
                  <p>Betwixt this and the time of payment, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Swediſh Horſe troopes (both vnawares

                  <p>This newes being ſent vnto the <hi>Rhinegraue,</hi> ſome of his Horſe had order to put into <hi>Ober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> (three leagues from <hi>Strasburg</hi>) for preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe <hi>Hagenawers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time alſo were the French forces come vp to <hi>Lutzelſtein,</hi> within ſixe Leagues of <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and they alſo had an eye to thoſe Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.

                  </p>
                  <p>Before this time had the French King conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the concluſion with the Crowne of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and the confederate Proteſtant Princes, made at <hi>Heilbrun:</hi> to whom he now promiſed his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe, for the ſending vp of his army towards thoſe parts of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was, to take the Towne and Caſtell of <hi>Vdenheim</hi> or <hi>Philipsburg</hi> into his protection; according as the Lord of it,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19441:30"/>the Biſhop of <hi>Spyers</hi> (Elector of <hi>Tryers</hi>) had deſired. The cauſe why theſe French forces could not effect this, was, for that this <hi>Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> had a long time beene beſieged by the <hi>Rhinegraues</hi> forces.</p>
                  <p>By the 11. of <hi>December</hi> was the French army come as farre as <hi>Landaw</hi> and <hi>Germerſheim,</hi> in the edge of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and the ſame night di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of their officers lay in <hi>Spyers</hi> City.</p>

                  <p>The 8. of <hi>December</hi> thoſe Imperialiſts of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſ-Zabern,</hi> went againe towards their conſorts of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> and the next day ſome Ordnance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them; what they did we heare not.</p>

The <hi>Count</hi> conſidering the great danger which might happen to him vpon ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an approach, returned quickly and a faſt pace ſheltered himſelfe in a little Dorpe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rovure</hi> (betweene <hi>Hagenaw</hi> and <hi>Zauerne</hi>) fortifying himſelfe the beſt hee could poſſibly: Hoping that in caſe of neceſſitie hee might bee quickly ſuccoured by the Imperiall Garriſons, which were in <hi>Hagenaw</hi> and <hi>Zauerne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the time that the <hi>Rhinegraue</hi> made good the paſſes on his ſide the <hi>Marquiſe de la Force</hi> aduanced valourouſly within a League and a halfe of the Quarter of the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> whom hee hemed in ſo well on all ſides, that hee bereſt him of all hope of being relieued from the Cities of <hi>Hagenaw</hi> and <hi>Zuauerne,</hi> which were within two or three leagues of his Quarter.</p>
                  <p>The Count now ſeeing himſelfe in all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the world, both out of all hope to be relieued, and no wayes able to reſiſt them, and that the ſaid Dorpe into which hee was now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for his refuge, was ſtript bare of Victualls, and all other commodities by the <hi>Swedes</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the beſiegers of <hi>Hagenaw;</hi> hee diſpatched a Trumpet towards the Colonell of the <hi>Bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers</hi> (which was the neereſt to him) with a bit of a Letter, which conſiſted of nothing but complements of all ſorts, and of prayers that by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19441:35"/>his meanes he might come to ſome agreement; The Colonell of the <hi>Bloequiers</hi> could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing of himſelfe, concerning what he deſired; but ſent with all diligence toward the <hi>Marquis de la Force,</hi> who was returned to <hi>Bacara,</hi> after he had once eſtabliſhed and taken order for to hold beſieged the ſaid Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> and his troopes; to make them the ſooner to come to compoſition: To the requeſt of the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> this anſwere was returned; that hee ſhould ſend the Breuiat of that which hee deſired, by ſome perſons of credit, to whom hee ſhould giue power to determine of the one and the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Articles which ſhould bee propounded, to this the Count of <hi>Salm</hi> readily condiſcended, as being now hard put to it.</p>
                  <p>It was then concluded (Munday the 30. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> laſt) as followeth. That the Count of <hi>Salm</hi> ſhould deliuer the Citie of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> and all the fortifications of the ſame to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>King,</hi> into the hands of <hi>Marſhall de la Force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the morrow being Tueſday, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 31. the Imperiall troopes which were in Garriſon in the ſaid Citie, ſhould march out the ſame day in the morning; and leaue the place free to the French Troopes.</p>
                  <p>That the Magazins of Armes and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould bee deliuered, and put into the hands of ſuch perſons as the Marſhall ſhould pleaſe to name, to take poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>That the Garriſons which were in the Caſtle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19441:35"/>of <hi>Aubar,</hi> neere <hi>Zauern,</hi> ſhould depart the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the <hi>Marquis de la Force</hi> had now all the authoritie of his Farher, hee promiſeth to the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> to giue him free paſſage into the <hi>Franche County;</hi> which hee deſired.</p>
                  <p>The which Articles were the ſayd day the 31 day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> ſealed by the one and the other party.</p>
                  <p>About eight a Clocke the ſame morning, there marched out of the Citie of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> 6. companies of Foote, and 4. of Horſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Troopes; which were in Garriſon in the Citie: And about ten a Clocke after, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Quarter-maſters of the <hi>French</hi> Army: And incontinently vpon that, 2. <hi>French</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which tooke poſſeſſion, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues maſters of the Ports and principall places of the ſaid Citie.</p>
                  <p>Mounſieur the <hi>Marquis de la Force</hi> entered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two or three a Clocke, after dinner, with a number of Gentlemen, and his Horſe troopes; where hee was receiued with a very good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement by the inhabitants, who all cryed in their language, God ſaue the King.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the finiſhing of this treaty, Mounſieur the <hi>Marſhall de la Force</hi> made good the promiſe of the <hi>Marquis</hi> his Sonne, and gaue paſſage to the Count of <hi>Salm</hi> for to goe (as is ſaid) into the <hi>Franche County:</hi> Neuertheleſſe hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyed along thorow the Lands poſſeſſed by the King, by the Regiment of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19441:36"/>
                     <hi>Auquincourt,</hi> and two Troopes of Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the City of <hi>Zauern,</hi> diſtant 4. Leagues from that of <hi>Hagenaw:</hi> The Garriſon which is in the ſame for the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> vpon the Summons by vs made, hath demanded 4. dayes reſpit for to giue aduice to his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This Citte cannot hold out (as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) the Caſtle of <hi>Aubar,</hi> which commands moſt of the ſaid Citie, is vnder the obedience of the King: And hee hath in it 2. <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Citie of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> which in Warre ſeemed able to reſiſt all the forces that would aduenter themſelues againſt it, came into the power of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is a matter of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For that the <hi>French</hi> grow very ſtrong in thoſe parts, by hauing this Towne, and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Hanaws</hi> countrey: By this is <hi>Lorraine</hi> hemed in on that ſide, and the edge of <hi>Germany</hi> open to them: And had they gotten <hi>Vdenheim</hi> too, they had beene great maſters vpon the edge of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you already heard what the <hi>French</hi> Nation hath reported of this action, in honour of their owne Nation. But whereas the authour of that relation hath quite left out the <hi>Rhinegraue,</hi> as if his part had bin no other but the blocking vp of ſome paſſages (and that by the <hi>Marſhall de la Forces</hi> direction too) wee ſhall now afford you a more punctuall ſtory of the

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> about the time of the former ſurrender of <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> was vpon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Germanie,</hi> not to meete with <hi>de la Force,</hi> but ſeeking another way to auoide him; he was not reported to be aboue 700. ſtrong, both horſe and foote; and with theſe he paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Newenburg,</hi> ſtaying ſome few dayes at <hi>Bintzheim</hi> the vpper <hi>Marquiſate.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By this time was the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> who hauing gotten all the Imperialiſts of the Countrey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, marcht now with great confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Rhinegraue;</hi> To whom were ſome few alſo ſent from <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and ſuch other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour places as could beſt ſpare them: All theſe together could not make him aboue 2000. men in Field; in the day of the ſucceeding battell, the aduerſe partee were full 6000. men, horſe and foote, who made no other account at all but to hembe in the <hi>Rhinegraues</hi> ſmall number, and to cut them all in pieces; And now did the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts aſſemble their ſtrength together about <hi>Danu</hi> aforeſaid, being ſaid to bee 7000. men, that is to ſay 1000.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19441:43"/>ſhould trie to breake through the <hi>Schwartzwaldt</hi> ouer the Mountaines: And for the better ſhow of the trueth of this intention; there was ſome ſtore of prouant bread at that time ſent into <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg:</hi> The Captaine alſo related, how that the Emperour was very much altered with the loſſe of thoſe Countreyes of <hi>Alſatia</hi> (which as hee ſaid) his Maieſtie would by no meanes forſake, or ſo giue ouer; He ſaid moreouer, that he would ſtraine himſelfe to maintaine <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and his owne hereditary Countreyes, and that hee would conclude an honourable peace with the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> but as for the reſt of the Empire, hee did leſſe regard it; for ſeeing they had beene alwayes diſobedient and croſſe vnto him, hee would find meanes well enough to keepe them vnder; perchance indeede it was the meaning of <hi>Iohn de Werth</hi> to haue broken through into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> ſeeing that hee two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times appeared in <hi>Overland</hi> which was the way out of <hi>Bauaria</hi> to it; both which times were his Troopes and purpoſes defeated by <hi>Guſtavus Horn;</hi> as you may reade in the chapter of his Storie.</p>
               <p>By the end of <hi>February,</hi> did the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> ſuppoſe himſelfe to be ſtrong enough, to haue wrought his will, vpon the <hi>Rhinegraue,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing he could not on the ſudden be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with his owne forces from other partes of the Country: which the Imperiall parties, now gone out of <hi>Briſſacke,</hi> put to the defenſiue; vpon Sunday therefore <hi>March</hi> 2. 12. the <hi>Lorraines</hi>

               <p>Immediately hereupon, they both riding to their Troopes, gaue order to let flie their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to make the breach wider, and that their whole Army ſhould turne into it.</p>
               <p>To performe this were the Souldiers now moſt eager, not onely out of courage and hope of Booty, but to reuenge withall the death of their fellowes and comrades, thus baſely murdered.

But now were the Victors eares as cloſe ſlopped, as the others had beene heretofore: For by this time had the Felt-Martiall lead on, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19441:54"/>his people to the Aſſault, put them into the breach, and had giuen them this watchword, <hi>Thus Fortunate.</hi>

               <p>The Gouernour of the Towne (who went vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Crutches) hauing hid himſelfe in the Church Steeple, was vpon promiſe of a great ranſome taken priſoner by a Lieutenant. But it is beleeued verily that the <hi>Landgraue</hi> will put him vpon a Martiall Court, for the tryall of his life; to ſee whether hee had behaued himſelfe in this Action according to the Law of Armes, or not; For aſſured it is by thoſe priſoners that were ſaued, that hee had not aboue halfe a Tun of Powder left to hold out the Towne withall; ſo that hee had neither reaſon, nor policie with him, to be thus obſtinate, but hath to anſwere rather (and that very deepely) for ſo much blood-ſhedding, and for the deſtruction of ſuch a Citie.</p>

               <p>By this fire was the whole Towne (excepting ſome few houſes) quite conſumed vnto Aſhes, and the whole prouiſion of Corne ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>The Salt-coates, or Salt-houſes from whence this Towne had her name, and did get her liuing, were not at all touched by the fire.

               <p>That Euening did the <hi>Landgraue</hi> and the Felt-Martiall draw off their Troopes, cauſing them to ſtand the whole night following in the open field, in Battaglia: The reaſon for which was, for that the Gouernour of the Towne had very confidently giuen it out, that <hi>Boninghauſen</hi> would bee there that night to relieue him.

               </p>
               <p>This Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> hoping to obtaine Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality from the Swediſh, was very ſecret in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. It was by ſome ſuppoſed that he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the invitation of the Catholike Princes of the German League; who offered him to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo of their forces. And that this title (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confidence perhaps, he had in the Duke of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> then comming into <hi>Germany</hi>) after he had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely accepted of, yet upon the thriving of the Swedes and Haſſians aboue in <hi>Germany,</hi> (and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing that after the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and his Army were come to nothing, and that the ſtrong and moſt important towne of <hi>V denheim</hi> or <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsburg</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was taken; and the French marcht up into <hi>Germany</hi>) upon all theſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19441:64"/>conſiderations, tis beleeved, the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> fell off againe from his Generaliſſimo-ſhip, and ſent no ſouldiers along, either with the Culleners, or the 7 Spaniſh Regiments. He was afraid, withall, of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> with whom he had Neutrality for his lands in the Dukedome of <hi>Cleve.</hi> And whereas he had ſuffered ſome of theſe new levied Spaniſh forces, to quarter in this his Country, he ſent an Ambaſſadour unto the States to excuſe this, as no breach of the Neutrality; becauſe though the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nation be enemies to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> yet were not theſe very <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces, intended againſt them. The States anſwer was ſaid to be to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: That they ſaw the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> was a good hoſpitable Prince: and therefore they will ſend him ſome gueſts too. Therefore (tis ſaid) that <hi>Pinſen</hi> went up to his Countrey, with forces: who had inſtructions from the Lords the States, to haue an eye unto the Dukes leuyes and motions. They alſo ſent their Ambaſſadours to him, to diſarme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and to give over his levies. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Neutrality, both with the Swedes and Hollanders; yet gaue he out Patents for the leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 12000 men: yea and impoſed contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his ſubiects, proportionable to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of thoſe numbers. Yea he had already, in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> made ſome Muſters; and baked provant bread. Thus much alſo hee put his ſubiects unto; that ſuch as were not able to pay for others, muſt ſerue perſonally. The Lords the States thereupon, ſent their 2 Ambaſſadours, (the Lord of <hi>Arnheim,</hi> and <hi>Ripperoda,</hi> as their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19441:64"/>names are written) about midd <hi>February,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to disband his new forces; and thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which he had levied upon Spaniſh pay. His anſwer was, That he did it to ſecure his Countrey againſt the Swediſh: to which their replye was, That they would be his warrant for it. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, all this notwithſtanding, the Duke continued his levies: then did the States ſend up their <hi>Pinſent,</hi> in March following, both to have an eye to him; and to be neere at hand with his land of <hi>Cleve;</hi> upon the leaſt breach of the Neutrality, or ayding of their enemies. And this, (for the generall) is the preſent eſtate of the Duke of <hi>Newburg:</hi> who armes, and yet does nothing: who would faine ayde his fellow Catholicks; pretends to feare the Swedes; does actually feare to offend the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers: and therefore, (openly) dares not aide the Catholicks.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19441:66"/>and ruine of all the Evangelicall States and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; Therefore they could not do otherwiſe, but to think and to reſolve upon Chriſtian, honeſt, excuſable, and by all Lawes, but eſpecially by the Statutes and Conſtitutions of the Roman Empire, permitted and approved meanes, whereby the ſaid States might recover what hitherto both againſt God and the humane Lawes, hath been taken and with holden from them; and withall redreſſe and deliver their poore oppreſſed and diſtreſſed ſubiects from the miſeries and calamities which this great while they ſuffer: defend and maintaine them from all wrong, unlawfull force and power; and thus leave behinde them to the poſterity, a true teſtimony of the dutifull care they have for the glory of God, for the preſervation of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the liberty of their Country, and their owne protection, and of their friends.</p>
               <p n="1">1 And accordingly having in the name of God, well conſidered and maturely weighed the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth Article of the propoſition, they have found it very neceſſary, to make before all things among themſelves, the Princes and States of this Circle, a true, faithfull, and unfained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, confederation, and union of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Minds, and Armes; And therefore as they are already bound together as united members of the ſaid Circle, according to the Conſtitution of the Empire; ſo now by theſe preſents they do conjoyn and binde themſelves together in the firmeſt ſort, to ſtand and to keep faithfull together, and none to forſake the other, but willingly to ſpend together
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19441:67"/>their blood, goods, and lives; and withall patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undergo and ſuffer together, what proſperity and adverſity the warre uſually doth afford.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And calling to minde how the Circle of <hi>Vpper Saxony</hi> (as their neereſt neighbours) hath alwayes kept a good correſpondence with this Lower Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, They do think fit with all poſſible ſpeed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the ſame to the like ſtreighter conjunction and union, not doubting, but the Elector, Princes, and States of the ſaid Circle, will not diſlike, but rather approve of this well intended care, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and as they hitherto (to their immortall honour) have done, ſo hereafter they will aſſiſt the Evangelicall affaires, advancing the ſame with an unanimous and conſtant counſell and aſſiſtance: and to the ſame end ſhall alſo the Evangelicall States of the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> be invited.</p>

               <head>OF THE AFFAIRES IN <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and of the Generaliſſimo (the Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi>) his death. CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas it will not be amiſſe (we hope) to beſtow here ſome few leaues or lines on the lamentable death of him, who by the actions of his life hath oftentimes afforded us many a diſcourſe. Therefore wee will preſent unto you a ſhort view, of what paſt a little before, at, and after, the murther committed on the perſon and friends of that great Imperiall <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſsimo,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Friedland;</hi> as things coadhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to what we treat of.</p>
               <p>About ſuch time as the Duke of <hi>Friedland</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a peace with the Swedes and Princes of the Vnion, (whereof we haue ſpoken in our fifth part) certaine Letters written at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria</hi> Sept. the 13 were intercepted, by which not onely the end of the Treaty of peace in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> but other plots, and counſels of the Popiſh party were alſo clearely diſcovered. The tenor of which letters was as followeth;</p>
               <p>P. P. I have privately learned by ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Officers, that as long as the chiefe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19441:71"/>in <hi>Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Saxonie</hi> are Maſters of the field, the Imperiall army is ſecure from danger. For by our promiſes and late deviſed treaties of peace, we have already gained more then we could haue done with 20000 ſouldiers, which putteth us in hope that the bleſſed Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> will both be preſent with us, and further us in our deſignes. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> by theſe actions, are not onely much increaſed, but the Heretikes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo troubled, and divided amongſt themſelues, that now they will ſcarce truſt each other, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man looking to his owne private ends, gapeth after his owne peculiar gaine, his owne particular pacification, like ſo many ſnarling Curres, ſnapping each at other. The Swediſh government, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be ſo odious to the Heretickes, that it is no queſtion but like a ſhip without a Pilot, they will quickely ſplit upon the Rocks, and loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Elector of <hi>Saxen</hi> (as things now ſtand) will much promote the buſineſſe. The King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> will attempt the deſtruction of <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and perſwade the other Princes to his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The moſt Chriſtian King ſhall ſhortly be ſent to his grave, and his brother advanced to the Kingdome. The Catholike King will give the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers more then their hands full; his Plate-Fleete returning yeerely laden with treaſure from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> hath raiſed the Cuſtome in the Sound , the <hi>Elve</hi> and <hi>Weſer,</hi> to the great offence of the people, which yet he intendeth to continue, and by all meanes aſſiſt our party.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:19441:72"/>Into the County of <hi>Tyroll,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Swaben,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> joyning with the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> ſhall firſt take the places neere the <hi>Danube,</hi> and then breake thorow the Dukedome of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to diſperſe the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red handfulls of the enemy there, and deliver the Duke of <hi>Lorraine.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> with one part of his Army ſhall invade <hi>Thuringia, Franconia</hi> and <hi>Heſſen,</hi> with the other, paſſing the <hi>Oder,</hi> the <hi>Elue,</hi> and the ſtraights of <hi>Vpper</hi> and <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Saxony,</hi> ſhutting up the paſſages after him, ſhall bring theſe parts to his ſubiection. It is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, how happily our councells goe forward, and with what earneſtneſſe, our Penſioners weary of the Swedes, proſecute their intentions. The heavens at laſt, will take away theſe troubles, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things will follow, that after the conqueſt of the Heretickes, wee may render thankes to all the Saints.</p>
               <p>N B. The Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> ſupported with the helpe of the Spaniards will not ceaſe, till hee have reſtored the whole Countrey of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> with the other Biſhops into their former eſtate. This is our generall peace, one Sheapheard, one Sheepfold, and one Monarke.</p>
               <p>Thus much ſaid thoſe intercepted letters. But how the ſaid laſt treaty betwixt the Duke of <hi>Frid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Arnheim</hi> did proceed, and how on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it broke off to the great confuſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> that you have understood for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in the latter end of the fifth part of our Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hiſtory; Where even as the unexpected brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19441:72"/>of that falſe treaty did almoſt breake the necke of the proteſtant army and affaires: So the unlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for taking of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> brake the necke of the Duke of <hi>Fridlands</hi> proſperous proceedings in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania</hi> and <hi>Sileſia;</hi> for the adviſes that were brought of the loſſe of the ſaid City, made <hi>Fridland</hi> to change his minde, and forced him to ſpeed his march backe againe towards <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Where Duke <hi>Bernhard</hi> cauſed great feare. But the yeere being farre ſpent, ſnow and froſt did freeze <hi>Fridlands</hi> further deſignes; Who having, by the ſending of 4 Regiments into <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> aſſured that paſſage and country to the Emperour, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Pilſen;</hi> Where, inſtead to aſſault others, he was aſſaulted (and almoſt carried away) by the gout.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this ſickneſſe, was <hi>Friedland</hi> carefull enough to giue and receiue diſpatches, and to advance the Emperours ſervice. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Ianuary laſt, the troopes which he had left under <hi>Gallas</hi> and <hi>Shafgotz</hi> in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> tooke the towne of <hi>Wartenberg</hi> upon compoſition, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame, they tooke and detained all the Swediſh garriſon priſoners there. Some few dayes after they alſo tooke by aſſault the towne of <hi>Nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaw.</hi> But leaſt the Swedes might be blamed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe, in not requitting thoſe new-yeeres-gifts, which the Imperialiſts in the ſaid two places had beſtowed on them: Therefore Colonell <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,</hi> commanding the Swediſh troopes that lay in <hi>St. Iohn</hi> and <hi>Sanda,</hi> ſent ſome troops of Dragoons and other horſe towards <hi>Zedlitz</hi> (about 3 leagues from thence) there to viſite the enquartered Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19441:73"/>under Collonel <hi>Heſenburg.</hi> This Collonel being advertiſed of the Swedes comming, drew his troopes together, and with ſome 4 companies came out or the towne into the field, where meeting too ſoone with the ſaid Sweds, he was in the beginning of the skirmiſh ſlain by a bullet, wherby the Sweds got the advantage, that they put the Imperialiſts to flight, and ſlew of them about 200. The like new-yeers-gift did the Swediſh Garriſons of <hi>Oppeln</hi> and <hi>Brieg</hi> beſtow on the Imperiall troopes that lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quartered in the places neere about them; Whereof in the ſpace of 14 dayes by divers viſits they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw 14 companies. This befell betwixt the tenth and fiue and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> laſt.</p>
               <p>And about the very ſame time, <hi>Friedland,</hi> who hitherto had alwayes plaid both the Foxe and the Wolfe, well to ſerue his Maſter, could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the trap, which envie and ſlander had laid for him at the Imperiall Court.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the cauſes of his diſgrace and death, by ſeverall relations, are made as different, as divers are the affections of the relators: We therefore (without any partiality) will here impart unto you ſome of the one and the other party. The firſt taken out of <hi>Mercurius Gallobelgicus,</hi> lately come over, ſaith thus.</p>

And going towards
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19441:81"/>
                     <hi>Fridlands</hi> houſe they heard a great noyſe of the cries and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſions of <hi>Tertzky</hi> &amp; <hi>Kinsky</hi> their Ladies, who had already underſtood the cauſe of their griefe from a Page. Which the ſaid Collonel hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, preſently commanded the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to haſten and finiſh the ſervice of his <hi>Imperiall Majeſty,</hi> and divided them; appointing Captaine <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to goe to the Market place to Sergeant Major <hi>Leſley,</hi> and to cauſe him in the Collonels name to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the reſt of the dragons to goe watch and guard the ſtreets, for it was time; and to bid Captaine <hi>Debrox</hi> to goe to <hi>Fridlands</hi> quarter, who was up and at the window, hearing the cries &amp; lamentations of the ſaid two women: and becauſe the houſe had divers doors, Collonel <hi>Butler</hi> commanded <hi>Giraldine</hi> to place about it Guards of his Nation, that no body ſhould get out. The ſaid captaine <hi>Debrox</hi> going up, the Collonel ſtaid below, and captaine <hi>Dionyſio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the market, was by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Butler</hi> preſently commanded to

Being gone up, he found both the chamber o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and that captaine <hi>Debrox</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fulfilled the execution, having heard the body of the Traytor <hi>Fridland</hi> fall to the ground with a great noiſe, who had beene killed with a Partiſan, in this maner. When <hi>Debrox</hi> went up hee found two ſervants of his chamber, whereof the one asked him what he would have? ſaying further, that his Highneſſe reſted, and that they muſt not make a noyſe: whom a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier preſently thruſt thorow, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the other ſervants to flie away, leaving his Highneſſe al alone. The ſaid Captaine advancing to the doore of the chamber, which was locked, with his foote quickly opened it, and found <hi>Frid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> right againſt the doore in his ſhirt; to whom he ſaid, <hi>Thou Traitor to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, now thou muſt dye:</hi> to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

Afterwards the Collonel went to the Chancery, where he ſeazed upon all the Papers, leading a good Guard there; as likewiſe in <hi>Illo's</hi> lodging, and in the <hi>Fridlands</hi> Chamberlaines lodging, (the <hi>Baron of Shaffenberg,</hi> brother to him that is priſoner at <hi>Vienna.</hi>) At laſt they all retyred, after this execution, into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle againe, where Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Gordon</hi> was with his Guard: And to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came alſo Sergeant Major <hi>Leſley,</hi> who during <hi>Fridlands</hi> execution, kept watch in the Market place. This was done on Saturday the 25 of <hi>February</hi> this preſent yeare, 1634.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:19441:82"/>The next day being Shrove-Sunday, the gates of the Town of <hi>Egra</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned locked up, not any one being ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to goe out; and the aforeſaid Officers held counſell what would be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to bee done, becauſe they truſted not the ſouldiers of the Garriſon, nor the Burgers: at laſt they reſolved to bring in one hundred Muſquetiers more, with the Officers of Collonel <hi>Preiner's</hi> Regiment, who ſtayed all the ſaid day in Armes, with bullets in their mouthes, and burning matches.</p>
                  <p>The 27 of <hi>February</hi> (being Munday) Collonel <hi>Butler,</hi> accompanied by ſome others, went out of the Town, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with the Officers of the Count of <hi>Tertzki</hi> his horſe Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, telling them what was paſt, &amp; asking them whether they would be faithfull ſouldiers to his Imp: Majeſty: who anſwered unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, that they would live and dye in his ſervice. That being done, hee went with fifty horſe, as well of his owne, as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19441:83"/>of the ſaid Regiment, to deſcry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the enemy about <hi>Egra,</hi> on the Frontiers, but he returned the ſame day, without learning any thing.</p>
                  <p>The 28 and laſt of <hi>February</hi> went out a troope of Dragons, and of Cavallery, with a Lieutenant, to heare newes of Duke <hi>Frances Albert of Saxen,</hi> or ſome other enemy: and having met with the ſaid Duke, a League from <hi>Egra,</hi> with his traine of ſervants and two Trumpets, thinking to come (as hee had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) with all aſſurance to <hi>Fridland</hi> his great friend, of whoſe death he knew as yet nothing. The ſaid Lieutenant asked him by the way, <hi>What would you ſay, ſir, if Butler ſhould ſent you priſoner to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour?</hi> Whereat he did but laugh being ignorant of the buſineſſe, but they ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on his perſon, viſited his Coach, ſearching for papers, where they found ſome, with letters of importance, which they delivered to the ſaid Collonel <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi> And the ſaid Duke ſeeing them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
